# Wizard's Calculator

## Problem Statement
Gather 'round, code wizards! Deep within the ancient library of Programming, there’s a dusty old calculator that’s just itching to reveal its secrets. Your quest? Create a basic calculator app that does more than just crunch numbers—it’s got a hidden message waiting to be uncovered when users enter specific number combinations.

But hold on, it gets better! We want this app to have a sleek and simple UI, paired with some clever state management to keep everything running smoothly. Think of it as a magical calculator that not only performs arithmetic operations but also whispers sweet secrets to those who know the right codes.Can you bring this enchanting calculator to life? Let’s turn those digits into delightful discoveries! 🧙‍♂️✨

Objective: Develop a Flutter/React Native application. Additionally, produce a video POC showcasing the app's functionality (you can utilize an emulator to run the application and record your laptop screen using OBS Studio), and upload the generated APK file. 

## 🧙‍♂️ How It Works
1. **Basic Arithmetic**:
   - Tap the number buttons (`0`-`9`) and operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to form an equation.
   - Press `=` to calculate the result.

2. **Clear Display**:
   - Press `C` to reset the display and start a new calculation.

3. **Hidden Message**:
   - Enter the magic number `12345` and press `=` to unlock the secret message:
     ```
     🧙 You've unlocked the magic!
     ```
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid inputs will display `Error` to guide users.
